# Changelog

# [0.3.0](https://github.com/pankajudhas81/pi-claude-auth/compare/v0.2.0...v0.3.0) (2026-08-17) — fork release

### Changed

- Live-captured Claude Code **2.1.234** request shape: Agent SDK identity
  line, `cc_prompt_id`, `metadata.user_id` from `~/.claude.json`, session and
  request-id headers, full `anthropic-beta` list, `?beta=true`.
- `cch` is now structure-aware XXH64 on the final SDK JSON (not SHA-256 of
  the user text). Seed is overridable via `ANTHROPIC_CCH_SEED` — the native
  Bun seed still rotates per Claude Code release.
- Stop relocating Pi's system prompt into the first user message.
- Strip Pi 0.84+ official-API `fallbacks` on Claude Code OAuth (opus-5 400).

# [0.2.0](https://github.com/pankajudhas81/pi-claude-auth/compare/v0.1.3...v0.2.0) (2026-08-06) — fork release

### Changed

- Bump pinned Claude Code version `2.1.160` → `2.1.222` (`src/signing.ts`):
  billing header `cc_version` and user-agent must track the current Claude
  Code release. Runtime override via `ANTHROPIC_CLI_VERSION` unchanged.
- pi ≥ 0.83 compatibility: `ModelRegistry.authStorage` was removed in pi 0.83,
  so same-session credential injection is now feature-detected (works on older
  pi). On 0.83+, auth.json seeding covers the next session and `/login` the
  current one.
- Compile against `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent@^0.83.0` types
  (`OAuthCredential` export was removed; credential type now derived from
  `ProviderConfig`).

### Added

- `claude-sonnet-5` and `claude-opus-5` to the supported-models smoke test
  (`scripts/test-models.ts`); `CLI_VERSION` aligned to `2.1.222`.
- Pin-enforcement test for `CC_VERSION` (`src/signing.test.ts`).
- README: fork-status banner, updated supported-models table, version-pin and
  pi ≥ 0.83 troubleshooting notes.
